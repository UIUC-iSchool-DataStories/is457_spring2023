## Some notes about this Class

Participation in this class is absolutely key.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

You will be tasked with talking, creating, sharing, and discussing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:
be aware that participation in this class is key to success

---

## Participation Guidelines

We ask that you:

 * Utilize the Zoom features for "hand-raising"
 * Ask any questions that can be answered over chat using Zoom chat
 * Use Canvas resources & email (preferred) for communication outside of class

---

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 15% -- Graded in class activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 75% -- Assignments (group)

notes:
with this idea of the course, let's look at the overall way grading is going to work in this course

you will dive into the details more for the syllabus quiz, which is an assignment due next week designed to get you familiar with these details :D

the reading quizzes and in class activities are still being developed, so these are not all posted as of yet but we will update the Canvas with those items as soon as possible -- reading quizzes should be there early, but the graded activities may or may not be present until the week we will actually be doing them

more details on the graded in class activities next week when we start using them! as folks are still shifting around classes, we won't be grading any in class stuff this week


---

## Grading - Assignments

You will have five assignments:

 1. Tweet Critique (5-7 minute presentation in class with slides, in Weeks 5-10)
 2. Data Story Idea: Social Problem or Social Justice (1 page + short recording)
 3. Data Story Critique Proposal (written)
 4. Data Story Critique Final Submission (written)
 5. Recorded Data Story (3-5 minutes)
 6. Final data story (\~10 minutes max in class, last 2 weeks)
 
notes:
within the assignments category there is a break down further into individual assignments

all of these will be in groups and we'll talk a bit about how groups are going to work today but also later when we get closer to assigning the groups

---

## Groups

Working in a group is a required element of this class.

Group formation will be using the ["astromimicry" concept](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11218.pdf).

Design of group contracts will be part of an in class activity.

notes:
groups will be a combination of your selection and randomly assigned, following concepts of "astromimicry"

the basic idea is that you get to choose *one* person you want to work with and then we randomly assign you to a group with other 
folks in this "binary star" configuratioin

there will be an in class activity aimed at cementing the ways in which you will be working in a group -- i.e. how the group will communicate, how work will be divided, etc

more on this in the next week when we come to it!

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)

notes:

as I'm the nominal "data person" for this course (Prof. Zalot being the storytelling person), I just wanted to let folks know a bit about the tools we are using, namely Google Data Studio and Twine

google data studio is going to be used to build interactive visualizations in in-class activities

twine is used to make interactive text & image based online data stories and games


---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
please note that I am assuming that there are folks here that have zero programming background and that is not only fine, but it is great!

we are going to be using these resources in a way that does not require programming

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Excel/Google Sheets
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

notes:
with that in mind, if you are newer to programming and/or data analysis there are a few things you might want to check out including gaining some 
familiarity with Excel and/or Google sheets

for twine we will mostly be making use of a Markdown-like syntax which is just a more intuative way to use HTML where things like bullet points are formatted with astrexies instead of fancy HTML formatting.  There will be one or two HTML tags we might use to do things like include images, but we won't be doing anything super fancy

---

## Tools

 * [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) -- familiarity with Excel/Google Sheets
 * [Twine](https://twinery.org/) -- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), HTML (a tiny bit)
 
There is *not* a programming requirement or prerequisite for this course.

Recommended tutorials & recordings will be posted before classes.

notes:
for these topics, we will post some suggested resources including tutorials and recordings before class -- we have one for this class, but it is the first class so it is hard to do things before!

---

## Plagiarism

Academic integrity is vital to this course.  The _stories_ you tell and the
_visualizations_ you create must be your own, both in actuality and in
character.

However, there are many reasons to seek out assistance and help. We insist that
you cite every fragment of code that you utilize online.



---

## Introduction to Each Other

We're going to break up into breakout rooms, where you'll chat with each other about your *name*.

Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?

Afterward, we'll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit, and then we will break back out.

---

## Names - Visualization

In your new breakout rooms, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

We will break *back* into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.

## Our Tools

 * Python, with some Javascript along the way
 * Jupyterhub (possibly) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/)
 * Once in a while some git, and GitHub
 * Data!

---

## Visualization Contexts

 * Visualization just for you
 * Visualization for a peer
 * Visualization for everybody

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/viz_types.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->


---

We tell lies to visualize, but we _must_ be honest.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Orion_Nebula_-_Hubble_2006_mosaic_18000.jpg/1024px-Orion_Nebula_-_Hubble_2006_mosaic_18000.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

## Data "Framing"

 * Collection
 * Organization
 * Reduction
 * Representation

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<div style="height: 15em;"></div>

 1. Sensors read the current "fill" of the battery
    * Analog / digital conversion
    * Normalized with respect to expected "full"
 1. This is then scaled to a percentage
 1. The battery image is filled from left to right
 1. The image is then rasterized and displayed

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_bw.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

 * Some fixed maximum amount of damage
 * Each time damage is taken, decrement
 * Each time damage is reversed, increment
 * Display number of hearts as appropriate

## Honesty

Our choices must be:

 * Deliberate
 * Informed
 * Motivated
 * Justifiable

---

## Election Maps

Mark Newman of the University of Michigan has created visualizations of the
election maps from several of the most recent elections.  For more information
and context, see his page http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/ .

 * [Map 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statemapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statepopredblue1024.png)
 * [Map 3](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 4](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymappurpler1024.png)
 * [Map 5](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countycartpurple1024.png)

---

## Three Case Studies

We'll break up into groups.

1. Who is this visualization designed for?  Self, peer, or other?  Was it
   successful?
2. How do you think this data was collected and processed, and how does this
   reflect the story the visualizer wants to tell?
3. Where were choices made in representation of the data, and how do these
   choices influence your perception of it?
4. Can you think of an alternate presentation?
