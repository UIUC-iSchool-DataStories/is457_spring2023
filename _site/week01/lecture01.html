notes:
some basics, if you are here you probably know what time/space the class is taking place in but just know it won't change! :D

this class will be co-instructed by me and professor Andy Zalot -- I'll be covering some of the data things, and Andy will be covering the storytelling aspects

we have a wonderful TA **let TA introduce themselves!** who will be helping us out this semester

also, if you are curious where these slides live, the main page is this above link, but we will be linking the individual lecture slides in canvas as well

## Plagiarism

Academic integrity is vital to this course.  The _stories_ you tell and the
_visualizations_ you create must be your own, both in actuality and in
character.

However, there are many reasons to seek out assistance and help. We insist that
you cite every fragment of code that you utilize online.

---

## Inclusivity

"We support diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections."

Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of groups or characteristics
we respect and value.

## Introduction to Each Other

We're going to break up into breakout rooms, where you'll chat with each other about your *name*.

Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?

Afterward, we'll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit, and then we will break back out.

---

## Names - Visualization

In your new breakout rooms, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

We will break *back* into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.

## Our Tools

 * Python, with some Javascript along the way
 * Jupyterhub (possibly) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/)
 * Once in a while some git, and GitHub
 * Data!

---

## Visualization Contexts

 * Visualization just for you
 * Visualization for a peer
 * Visualization for everybody

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/viz_types.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->


---

We tell lies to visualize, but we _must_ be honest.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Orion_Nebula_-_Hubble_2006_mosaic_18000.jpg/1024px-Orion_Nebula_-_Hubble_2006_mosaic_18000.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->

## Data "Framing"

 * Collection
 * Organization
 * Reduction
 * Representation

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<div style="height: 15em;"></div>

 1. Sensors read the current "fill" of the battery
    * Analog / digital conversion
    * Normalized with respect to expected "full"
 1. This is then scaled to a percentage
 1. The battery image is filled from left to right
 1. The image is then rasterized and displayed

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_bw.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

 * Some fixed maximum amount of damage
 * Each time damage is taken, decrement
 * Each time damage is reversed, increment
 * Display number of hearts as appropriate

## Honesty

Our choices must be:

 * Deliberate
 * Informed
 * Motivated
 * Justifiable

## Election Maps

Mark Newman of the University of Michigan has created visualizations of the
election maps from several of the most recent elections.  For more information
and context, see his page http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/ .

 * [Map 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statemapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statepopredblue1024.png)
 * [Map 3](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 4](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymappurpler1024.png)

## Three Case Studies

We'll break up into groups.

1. Who is this visualization designed for?  Self, peer, or other?  Was it
   successful?
2. How do you think this data was collected and processed, and how does this
   reflect the story the visualizer wants to tell?
3. Where were choices made in representation of the data, and how do these
   choices influence your perception of it?
4. Can you think of an alternate presentation?
