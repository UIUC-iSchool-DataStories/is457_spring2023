# Intro to Data Sources

notes:
so today we are going to have a quick introduction to the suggested data sources that you might want to investigate for your final data stories

these are resources that are well vetted, *well documented* and are (relatively) easy to access and so are good to use for our kind of work

---

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

notes:
there is a video and a set of slides that walk you through the turnitin process which is how we are detecting plagurism which will be active on Assignment #4

---

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

notes:
so, I just want to call out here that this stuff isn't fun to talk about or think about!

---

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

But we [do have to think about it](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).

notes:
but, this is something that the university takes very seriously, so we do have to pay attention to these issues

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

But we [do have to think about it](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).

Using TurnItIn as we will in this course is our way to make this as transparent a process as possible.

notes:
so, as you'll see in the video and reading quiz - you will be able to see your turnitin report and the reasoning behind this is that we want you to be able to see *how we will assess* plagurism

why? because some folks have been thinking about citations and plagurism their whole lives, but folks are coming from educational systems in which they haven't had to deal with this as much

we want to support all of you!  so take this as a learning opportunity to understand a bit more about how to do technical writing at the UIUC educational environment

more info will be in the TurnItIn recorded lecture and slides!

# Intro to Data Sources (for real this time!)

notes:
now onto data sources for real this time!

---

# Data Sources

Our data sources.  Next week we will explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org


notes:
we'll be exploring these things more with GDS next week and the one after, but we'll get a quick intro here


---

## [data.world](https://data.world/)

To see datasets without logging in: https://data.world/datasets/open-data

(however to view, you will need to log in)

notes:
data.world -- you don't have to log in, city of chicago

city of chicago uses this alot

---

## [data.world](https://data.world/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataworld1.png" data-background-size="auto 85%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Contents of data.world/datasets/open-data]" -->

notes:
you'll see a list like this and a search function

look for chicago and pick one

---

## [data.world](https://data.world/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataworld2.png" data-background-size="auto 85%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Data view of Chicago City Council Votes and highlight on Explore this dataset button. Click this button for more info.]" -->

notes:
click on explore

---

## [data.gov](https://data.gov/)

All US data -- A LOT of data.

notes:
search -- climate and artic
search -- IMLS

---

## [data.illinois.gov](https://data.illinois.gov/)

Keep in mind: not all local governments use this (Champaign does not, Urbana is a bit old)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataillinoisgov.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[Looking at the contents of data.illinois.gov/group/local-government]" -->

notes: 
look at local governments

---

## [data.humdata.org](https://data.humdata.org/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/datahumdata.png" data-background-size="auto 75%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" aria-label="[The webpage data.humdata.org/dataset]" -->

notes:
this can be very useful data for this class and your final presentations

# Data Sources

Next week (or so) you will divide into groups and explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you
are interested in exploring.  Think about these things:

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?
 
Use Google Data Studio to make an interactive plot with your data. (More on how to do this when we get there).

notes:
use about 10 minutes to explore the data together

1. find interesting data
1. answer these questions together
1. you do *not* have to do any visualizations with this data at this step (some of the websites will have their own viz options as well)

**more about this next week!**
