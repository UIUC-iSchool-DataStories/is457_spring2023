# Data Sources

Divide into groups.  Explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you
are interested in exploring.  Think about these things:

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?

notes:
we'll be exploring more data in groups today

before doing anything -- ask these three questions

data.world -- you don't have to log in, city of chicago

---

## data.world

To see datasets without logging in: https://data.world/datasets/open-data

(however to view, you will need to log in)

notes:
city of chicago uses this alot

---

## data.world

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataworld1.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
you'll see a list like this and a search function

look for chicago and pick one

---

## data.world

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataworld2.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
click on explore

---

## data.gov

All US data -- A LOT of data.

notes:
search -- climate and artic
search -- IMLS

---

## data.illinois.gov

Keep in mind: not all local governments use this (Champaign does not, Urbana is a bit old)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dataillinoisgov.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes: 
look at local governments

---

## data.humdata.org

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/datahumdata.png" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
this can be very useful data for this class and your final presentations

notes:
use about 10 minutes to explore the data together

1. find interesting data
1. answer these questions together
1. you do *not* have to do any visualizations with this data at this step (some of the websites will have their own viz options as well)

---

# Go explore data webpages!

notes:
take about 10 minutes

come back, share out

---

## Brainstorm reports!

https://jamboard.google.com/d/1bDiQWDVVNq8W1tAm9ziXSAyu12OMX89SjYq7sY4N_CE/edit?usp=sharing

What charts/text/visualizations might support a possible story?

notes:
before visualizing this data in google data studio, lets take some time to outline some graphs you might want to show based on what stories you were looking for

this is a *ROUGH* draft - just think about different kinds of objects you might want to make

take about 10 minutes!

## Plots in Google Data Studio!

(More info about geo-data next week!)

Suggestion \# 1: download (csv/xlsx) $\rightarrow$ up load to drive $\rightarrow$ open in Google Sheets $\rightarrow$ connect in Google Data Studio

Suggestion \# 2: refer to Week 01 and Week 02 slides!


notes:
after sharing out, the rest of the time you'll work in groups to start making some plots with your data

I'd suggest staying away from geo-plots right now (i.e. plots on a map) as we'll cover some ways to do this effectively next week

For data.world, you *can* use a connector, but in general, its probably easier to download a CSV/XLSX file and upload it to your drive and open in a google sheets

also, don't forget you have slides/notes about how to do all of this in google datastudio from the last 2 weeks!

also remember: this is a *rough draft* its fine if you don't get to all of your plots, you can draw what you want them to look like in your report, we'll have more time to do this throughout the semester
