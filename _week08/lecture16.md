# Our Data Stories

* Character
* Setting
* Plot

We've spoken at length about these components and how they interact with our stories; we can map our data onto these narrative elements.

<p class="fragment">We must also take into account our role in the presentation; we bring unique motivation, style and methods to our storytelling.</p>

<p class="fragment">We can codify this in our presentation of our visualizations.</p>

# Why are we telling this story?

What is our motivation for presenting this information?  There can be many, and they are not necessarily advertised in the *text* of your tale.  You may find that the three types of story we have described map to one or more of these categories more frequently than others.

<p class="fragment">What are some reasons and contexts you anticipate telling a data story?</p>

<p class="fragment">Who might be in your audience?</p>

<p class="fragment">What is your relationship with them?</p>

# Why: Persuasion

Are you leading your audience to a conclusion?  What are some instances in which your primary motivation is to persuade someone of a piece of information?

<p class="fragment">What are different <i>levels</i> of conclusion that you might want to reach in a business setting, or a research setting?</p>

---
 
# Why: Collaborative Thinking
 
Perhaps your motivation behind telling the tale is to develop a collaborative discussion, and to present it as an unknown.

<p class="fragment">(Or maybe you just want it to seem like you're collaborating, but really you're leading?)</p>

<p class="fragment">How might you structure your talk, and choose what you do and do not include?</p>

---

# Why: To Tell a Tale
 
Sometimes telling a tale is just to tell it, to provide voice to information.

<p class="fragment">Sometimes we tell a tale without knowing <i>why</i> we tell it, at first, and we discover later.</p>

<p class="fragment">"Maybe the <i>real</i> treasure was the friends we made along the way."</p>

---

# How are we telling the story?

If we define a single piece of information, or a "state" in between transitions (slides, narrative, visual, or otherwise) we can think of how we navigate between those as falling into a few different categories.

<p class="fragment">This is not a <i>full</i> ontology of how to navigate, but it does touch on a few methods that are approachable.</p>

---

# How: Narrative Progression

The most straightforward approach to telling your data story is to identify a variable, and move along that variable.

<p class="fragment">Is that variable always time?  What other variables might there be?</p>

<p class="fragment">Are we moving monotonically?  Do we move at a fixed rate?  How do we ensure adequate information coverage?</p>

---

# How: Expansion of Components

We can *not* present all of the information in a narrative.  But, we can selectively expand on individual components.  For instance, you might choose individual items, "zoom" in on them and [describe them in detail](https://youtu.be/r7Eq3Hr0ehw?t=1595).

<p class="fragment">We see this with maps pretty often.</p>

<p class="fragment">What coverage do we want of the items we can present?  How do we choose our illustrative examples, and how is that informed by our motivations?</p>

---

# How: Non-linear Exploration

Perhaps we have no direction for describing -- we have many variables, many directions, or perhaps the variables are not as well defined?

<p class="fragment">How do you choose what to visit first?  What does 'visiting' an informational node mean in this context?</p>

<p class="fragment">

---

# How: Your Style

How controlling of the narrative process are you?

<p class="fragment">Are you an auteur, personally influencing not only the presentation but the journey for your audience?</p>

<p class="fragment">Do you have the opportunity to allow freedom of exploration?  How restrictive?  Where does the technology limit you?</p>

<p class="fragment">How reliant on appeals to emotion, empathy, relatedness or intuition is your data story?</p>

# Wrapping Up

How can we take these different aspects of the "why" and the "how" of our storytelling and construct our stories?

More specifically, how can we identify different *classes* of data that fall easily into these different models?
