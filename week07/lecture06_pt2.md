## General notes

We left you feedback, please read it carefully! (Even if you got a 5/5 on the assignment!)

notes:
there are comments for each of you, please read them carefully

we expect all items to be addressed in your final submission

## General notes

We left you feedback, please read it carefully! (Even if you got a 5/5 on the assignment!)

You can use whatever software you want to make the visualizations!

notes:
just a reminder: we listed a few viz software in the assignment like google data studio, R, Python, excel -- any of these is fine!  its whatever you are most comfortable with

there is the word "data" in this course's title so you do have to "do something" with data, but it doesn't have to use programming

## Some trends

Ideas for critiques:
 * critiques of visualizations
 * critiques of study/data collection methodolgies
 * critiques of foundational ideas in the article

notes:
nice proposals everybody!

so, we noticed three broad categories of proposed critiques and I've put them here layed out in what (I think anyway) is increasing order of complexity

---

## Some trends

Ideas for critiques:
 * critiques of visualizations
   * redo viz, talk about choices (yours & authors), ideas to make it better
 * critiques of study/data collection methodolgies
 * critiques of foundational ideas in the article

notes:
so, in my mind critique the viz is the "lowest hanging fruit"

you're already making the viz anyway, this is a great opportunity to talk about some choices you made and if you liked your choices better than the article

---

## Some trends

Ideas for critiques:
 * critiques of visualizations
   * redo viz, talk about choices (yours & authors), ideas to make it better
 * critiques of study/data collection methodolgies
   * sometimes mentioned in article/sometimes not, use of Data Hazard labels
   * might involve statistics, probably need to cite some methodogy sources if no obvious Data Hazards or if re-analysis is needed
 * critiques of foundational ideas in the article

notes:
next up is if you want to critique the methods of the data collection or analysis of data collection or analysis in the article

sometimes the article itself will actually talk about its faulty methodolgy and that can be useful to discuss

also, if you can see any Data Hazards, like the ones discussed for Tweet Critiques you can discuss these hazards here as well

if none of those things is evident, and you want to re-analize the data using your own methods, you will probably have to involve some statistics and do a bit of research for different analysis methods for different kinds of data (for example if its time dependent data, this can be VERY messy -- even a linear fit is not necessarily statistically sound!)

so, in summary this option could be not that much work or A LOT of work and research, depending on the article

   * sometimes mentioned in article/sometimes not, use of Data Hazard labels
   * might involve statistics, probably need to cite some methodogy sources if no obvious Data Hazards or if re-analysis is needed
 * critiques of foundational ideas in the article
   * extensive literature review of peer reviewed sources required
   * probable serious statistics involved

notes:
so, this last one will be a LOT of extra work -- we don't want to discourage you from doing it if you really want to, but we do want to be clear about what we are expecting

for example, if you want to say something along the lines of "I disagree with the claims in the article because they are not accurate or because I don't believe them" you need to back this up with peer reviewed research.

This may seem a little weird, but saying "the claims of the article are not accurate" is a VERY different statement than "the article does not present the data in an effective way (because of my analysis of the data viz)" or "the methodology of the analysis of the data in the article has some flaws"

If you want to say "claim #1 is incorrect" you need, on average 3-5 peer reviewed articles to "back" this up -- this is A LOT more work, so just be careful of this.  WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO DO THIS MUCH WORK FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT -- that is why we suggest that you think carefully about how to approach your critique.
