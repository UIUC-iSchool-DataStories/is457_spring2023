## Finding the story

 > "But the numbers keep on circling me..."

Let's talk about explaining things.

notes:

 * what is a framing device? put in a definition
 * reminder of data characters
 * twine: framework for interactive fiction, bandersnach was storyboarded in this, also choose your own adventure
 * remote/book -- tacktile sentation and control -- example of framing device, path through data
 * map -- this tells you where you are, w/rt data like bike trails, restaurants
 * HIV viz -- data informed vs. gapminder which is data driven (can reproduce data from graphs)
 * inductive vs deductive storytelling
 * framing for us: true or THE truth (data informed, data driven) AND control vs. leading viewer on a path
 * another example: how games teach you to play them (Myst!), record scratch meme, breaking the 4th wall
 
 * maybe start with "choose your own adventure" and bandersnatch
 * have formal definition
 * then some introduction examples
 * "state dependent learning" -- learning something within a specific context as an analogy in psychology
 
 * narrative: you go tell someone, or canned conversations in a game
 * navigable: user is in control, more invested in some cases
 * hybrid: spectrum!
 
FOR navigable
 * think about: how much control do you want to give your user? ex: GDS gives SOME control (over graphs) but not over which graphs are produced
 * causality? control? connection
 * static stories
 * hybrid examples -- bloomberg, interactives, maybe on bbc? (order is fixed) figures in the sky is great! -- framing discussion is the intro paragraph, order is whatever we choose -- causality means that we don't need to know one thing before the next
 * probably have the full list, but only look at these 2 (mention nixon sonification and link to twotone: https://twotone.io/)

## How do we tell stories?

 * Teller
 * Tale
 * Told

---

## Data Stories

Where does the data fit into this?

Where does the interaction fit into this?

---

## Informing versus Driving

Do you want your audience to be able to recreate your input data?  To make inferences?  Or is it appropriate to focus on conveying broad ideas, without one-to-one mapping of information to visualization?

Our stories must be *honest*.

How can we relate this to thinking about inductive as opposed to deductive storytelling?

---

## Framing Devices

Think of a video game, or a movie, where someone was introduced to something.

---

## Framing Devices

What do framing devices provide?

 * Context
 * Stability
 * Orientation

---

## Framing Devices: Context

<iframe seamless="seamless" style="width: 100%; border: none; display: block; max-width: 768px; height: 600px;" src="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/embed/cc875f97-6042-4c9b-861a-614c32cc08f2?autoplay=false"> </iframe>

## Framing Devices: Stability

## Framing Devices: Orientation

## Storytelling Form

 * Narrative
 * Navigable
 * Hybrid

---

## Style of Story: Navigable

Do we give the person control?  How much control?  What do we need to retain?

<ul>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Causality</b>: Do we want to start <i>en media res</i>? Are we just a bunch of events that happen to occur?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Control</b>: How many degrees of freedom do we provide? When does it become confusing?  Is it sequential, random access, or a hybrid?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Connection</b>: Does the experience (the teller) enable a connection between the data (the tale) and the viewer (the told)?</li>
</ul>

---

## Style of Story: Static

Things sit there.  People can explore with their eyes, but the reference points never change under their feet.

These can be effective, but can also be less visceral.

---

## Style of Story: Hybrid

A large-scale progression, coupled with intermediate diagrams that may be navigable.

---

## Style of Story: Examples

 * [Bloomberg 50](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-bloomberg-50/)
 * [Figures in the Sky](http://www.datasketch.es/may/code/nadieh/) (and [write-up](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/figures-in-the-stars))
 * [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/)
 * [Letter Frequency](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/frequency-letters)
 * [Legend of Nixon](https://twotone.io/examples/legend-of-nixon/)

## Designing Your Story

 1. What medium will you use?
    * How do you want people to "consume" it?
    * What are the pre-requisites?
    * What do you need to do to prepare it?
 2. What should it look like?
    * How "risky" should it be?
    * Is there a "visual language" you could use?
 3. Where are the dimensions?
    * What can change?
    * What can stay the same?
    * What can the audience control, and what can they not?

## You Can Do This

<p class="fragment">Yes, you can do this.</p>

<p class="fragment">Even the stuff that seems super technical and complicated.</p>

<p class="fragment">I wouldn't say this if it weren't true.</p>

---

## Resources

<ul>
<li class="fragment">There are tutorials out there.  Use these.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use templates.  Make them your own.</li>
<li class="fragment">Learn from others.  Ask questions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Find the fun things.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use stuff like <a href="https://iodide.io">iodide</a>, <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observable</a>, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/">safari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, and especially <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>.
</ul>

---

## Choosing a Medium

 * Will you be there?
 * How constrained is your story?
 * What technical abilities do you have?
 * How does the data interact?

---

## Technical Choices for a Medium

(Besides the one we're going to use today!)

[Explorables explanations](https://explorabl.es/) has a collection of [tools](https://explorabl.es/tools/) we can explore.

[Kinetic Graphs](https://kineticgraphs.org/) allows you to define specific characteristics, thus enabling mathematical formulas to be manipulated.

[Observable](https://observablehq.com/) is a platform for exploring interactive notebooks, and is particularly well-suited to visualization and design projects.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a straightforward way of creating HTML (or markdown) and placing it online.  This can include interactivity.

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) is an environment for exploration of web development and applications which can have server-side components.

## Twine

Today we are going to use Twine.

Twine is a way to build interactive narratives in the browser, that can be
experienced and guided.  We will cover the very basics of Twine, including
navigation and variables, and then we will split into groups to discuss how we
might use this for data stories.
